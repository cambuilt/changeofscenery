Two unmarried sisters of the Waring family bought the house in 1923. Leila Waring painted miniatures of Charlestonians in the first quarter of the 20 century, carrying on an art form generally associated with the pre-photography era. She added a northeast room as her studio shortly after moving into the building. May Waring, her sister, was a well-known local writer.<br/><br/>This house has been broken into a 4 bedroom and a 3 bedroom condo, both valued at about $2M. ",

President Taft viewed the city from the top of this building and said \"I don't believe that it did ruin the skyline, but if it did, the view from up here makes it worth it.\" <br/><br/>When the building was opened in 1911, people visited just to ride the elevators. <br/><br/>People's Bank closed in 1936 and the building was bought by Southeastern Securities Co.
